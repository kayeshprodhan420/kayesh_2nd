					<h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>
					<P>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</P>

					<h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
					<P>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</P>

					<h1>GRAPHICS DESIGN</h1>
					<P>Graphic design is the profession and academic discipline whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Therefore, it is an interdisciplinary branch of design[1] whose foundations and objectives revolve around the definition of problems and the determination of objectives for decision-making, through creativity, innovation and lateral thinking along with digital tools, transforming them for proper interpretation. This activity helps in the optimization of graphic communications (see also communication design). It is also known as visual communication design, visual design or editorial design.</P>

					<h1>COPY TYPIST</h1>
					<P>Copy typists learn to touch type at a high speed, which means they can look at the copy they are typing and do not need to look at the keyboard they are typing on. The source, or original document is called the copy. They have the document to be typed in front of them and the copy is often held in a copyholder.</P>

					<h1>PRESENTATION SLIDE</h1>
					<P>A slide is a single page of a presentation. Collectively, a group of slides may be known as a slide deck. A slide show is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen.

						Before the advent of the personal computer, a presentation slide could be a 35 mm slide viewed with a slide projector[1] or a transparency viewed with an overhead projector.
						
						In the digital age, a slide most commonly refers to a single page developed using a presentation program such as MS PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, Apache OpenOffice or LibreOffice. It is also possible to create them with a document markup language, for instance with the LaTeX class Beamer.
						
						Lecture notes in slide format are referred to as lecture slides, frequently downloadable by students in .ppt or .pdf format.</P>

					<h1>DATA ENTRY</h1>
					<P>Data entry, a person-based process,[1] is "one of the important basic"[2] tasks needed when no machine-readable version of the information for planned computer-based analysis or processing is readily available.[3]

						Sometimes what is needed is "information about information (that) can be greater than the value of the information itself."[4] It can also involve filling in required information which is then "data-entered" from what was written on the research document, such as the growth in available items in a category.[4]:68 This is a higher level of abstraction[5] than Metadata, "information about data."[6]</P>
